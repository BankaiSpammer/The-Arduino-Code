# The-Arduino-Code
what was used in order to make the thing:
these were the resources i used:
- https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/library-examples/curie-ble/Genuino101CurieBLEHeartRateMonitor/
- https://how2electronics.com/pulse-rate-bpm-monitor-arduino-pulse-sensor/
- https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Bio_Sensor_Hub_Library  (this was as an example to see how others do it, and github was the perfect place)
- https://github.com/maximtrp/heart-sensor
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/121qHKYW9TaB6_tUbtgEeZ4WFFKlCWMK_/view

i also wrote the code first in Python and then i converted it to C language, reason why i did that was because i am more familiar with python and it was easier for me to write in it and then i converted the code to C language which took a bit of time. But since this project is small there wasnt an a lot amount of programming, as we are just meassuirng the heart rate with arduino. 

Some problems i encountered were:
- i did not know how to start with this in c language so instead i wrote the entire code in python and then i converted it to C langauge
- another thing that happened was that the serial monitor would not work sometimes and i had to look for the mistake and make sure all the libarys are connected and work, the same thing also happened for serial poltter which plots the heart rate, and i alo had a bit of problems with the bluetooth monitor so i did not know how to implement the code
- also some problems that appeared were was that the code took a long time to upload 
- the other problem was that when i connected the bluetooth module, and downloaded the terminal on the phone sometimes when i typed a message it would not appear in the computer or in the phone and that caused some problems which i had to fix and modify the code as well as the terminal on the phone
