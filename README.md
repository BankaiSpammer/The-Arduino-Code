# The-Arduino-Code
what was used in order to make the thing:
these were the resources i used:
- https://docs.arduino.cc/retired/library-examples/curie-ble/Genuino101CurieBLEHeartRateMonitor/
- https://how2electronics.com/pulse-rate-bpm-monitor-arduino-pulse-sensor/
- https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Bio_Sensor_Hub_Library  
- https://github.com/maximtrp/heart-sensor
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/121qHKYW9TaB6_tUbtgEeZ4WFFKlCWMK_/view
- https://github.com/megaconfidence/bt-heart-monitor

i also wrote the code first in Python and then i converted it to C language, reason why i did that was because i am more familiar with python and it was easier for me to write in it and then i converted the code to C language which took a bit of time. 

Some problems i encountered were:
- another thing that happened was that the serial monitor would not work sometimes and i had to look for the mistake and make sure all the libarys are connected and work, the same thing also happened for serial poltter which plots the heart rate, and i alo had a bit of problems with the bluetooth monitor so i did not know how to implement the code
- also some problems that appeared were was that the code took a long time to upload 
- the other problem was that when i connected the bluetooth module, and downloaded the terminal on the phone sometimes when i typed a message it would not appear in the computer or in the phone and that caused some problems which i had to fix and modify the code as well as the terminal on the phone
- the biggest porbalme  that happneded was that something happened with arduino uno and when i uploaded the code it would not send it to the arduino and arduino could not make commands, this was a very annoying problem and required me to chnage the arduino board as there was something wrong with it internally 

The materials that were used to create the project:
= Arduino IDE
= Pulse Sensor
= Breadboard
= Jumper Wires
= USB cable
= Arduino Uno
= Bluetooth HC=05
